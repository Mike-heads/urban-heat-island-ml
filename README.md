# Urban Heat Island Prediction 🌆🔥

End-to-end geospatial machine learning project to predict Urban Heat Island (UHI)
intensity using satellite imagery, meteorological data, road proximity and building density.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely
- Sentinel-2 (Planetary Computer)
- Scikit-learn

## Pipeline
1. Ground data preprocessing
2. Geospatial feature engineering
3. Satellite feature extraction
4. ML modeling (Random Forest)

## Note
This project uses public or synthetic data and replicates a real-world workflow.
